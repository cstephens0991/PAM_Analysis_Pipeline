# PAM_Analysis_Pipeline
Series of packages for the automation of PAM analysis from 24- or 48-well plates, using images generated by ImagingWin software.

The PAM analysis pipeline automates the extraction of plant photosynthetic area and photosynthetic efficiency (FvFm or Y(II)) data. These scripts, specifically for obtaining FvFm values of plants, was based on scripts previously published by Schneider et al., 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13007-019-0546-1) and released by the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (https://plantcv.danforthcenter.org/). Thanks also to Walz GmbH (creator of ImaginWin software) for providing the pim2tiff executable for conversion of .xpim image files to tiff stacks.
